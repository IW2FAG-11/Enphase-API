Get/Set network information and/or perform network diagnostics.

== Introduction

Enphase-API is an unofficial project providing an API wrapper and the documentation for Enphase(R)'s products and services.

More details on the project are available from the xref:../../../../README.adoc[project's homepage].

== Request

The `/admin/lib/network_display.json` endpoint supports the following:
