Used by the JavaScript datatable to return event log records.

== Introduction

Used by the JavaScript datatable (see http://legacy.datatables.net/usage/server-side) to return event log records. `iDisplayLength` sets the number of records to return (defaults to 1) and if set to `-1` will return all records.

Enphase-API is an unofficial project providing an API wrapper and the documentation for Enphase(R)'s products and services.

More details on the project are available from the xref:../../../README.adoc[project's homepage].

== Request

A HTTP `GET` to the `/datatab/event_dt.rb` endpoint provides the following response data.

As of recent Gateway software versions this request requires user authentication and authorisation, see xref:../Authentication.adoc[Authentication].
