This retrieves the information and status of the live status functionality. The MQTT client and meter states and the counters supporting it.

== Introduction

Enphase-API is an unofficial project providing an API wrapper and the documentation for Enphase(R)'s products and services.

More details on the project are available from the link:../../../../README.adoc[project's homepage].

== Request

A HTTP `GET` to the `/ivp/livedata/status` endpoint provides the following response data.

As of recent Gateway software versions this request requires a valid `sessionid` cookie obtained by link:../../Auth/Check_JWT.adoc[Auth/Check_JWT].
