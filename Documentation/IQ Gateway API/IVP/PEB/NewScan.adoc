Start, stop or get the results of a new scan for devices.

== Introduction

A HTTP GET to `/ivp/peb/newscan` can be used to get details about the device scan running on the PCU ("Power Conditioning Unit", also called "microinverters") Envoy Bridge (PEB).

Enphase-API is an unofficial project providing an API wrapper and the documentation for Enphase(R)'s products and services.

More details on the project are available from the xref:../../../../README.adoc[project's homepage].

== Request

The `/ivp/peb/newscan` endpoint supports the following:
