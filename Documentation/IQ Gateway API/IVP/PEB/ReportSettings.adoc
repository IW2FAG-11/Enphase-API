Get or set the priority for reporting to Enphase(R) Cloud (formerly "Enlighten(R) Cloud").

== Introduction

Get or set the priority for reporting to Enphase(R) Cloud (formerly "Enlighten(R) Cloud").

The JSON PUT data is sent incorrectly as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8`. A diagnostic mode may also be enabled, which temporarily sets the `bandwidth` to `high`.

Enphase-API is an unofficial project providing an API wrapper and the documentation for Enphase(R)'s products and services.

More details on the project are available from the link:../../../../README.adoc[project's homepage].
