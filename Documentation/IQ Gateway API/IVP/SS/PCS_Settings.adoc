Get or set Power Control System (PCS) details.

== Introduction

Get or set Power Control System (PCS) details. PCS systems limit current and loading on the busbars and conductors supplied by the power production sources and/or energy storage systems irrespective of self-consumption. The PCS is similar to the Power Export Limit (PEL) however PCS also monitors grid import loads and will ensure a total current (before consumption) is not exceeded from grid, storage or solar production.

Enphase-API is an unofficial project providing an API wrapper and the documentation for Enphase(R)'s products and services.

More details on the project are available from the link:../../../../README.adoc[project's homepage].

== Request

A HTTP `GET` to the `/ivp/ss/pcs_settings` endpoint provides the following response data.

As of recent Gateway software versions this request requires a valid `sessionid` cookie obtained by link:../../Auth/Check_JWT.adoc[Auth/Check_JWT].

|Description

|`PVOversubscription`
|Boolean
|Boolean (e.g. `true` or `false`)
|Photovoltaic (PV) oversubscription.

|`EnchargeOversubscription`
