Get the Energy System (formerly "Ensemble") status using Zigbee Security Control (SecCtrl) messages. The Gateway (formerly "Envoy") communicates with both the IQ System Controller (formerly "Enpower") before version 3 and the IQ Battery (formerly "Encharge") before IQ battery 5P (i.e. IQ Battery 3, 3T, 10 and 10T) using encrypted Zigbee.

== Introduction

Enphase-API is an unofficial project providing an API wrapper and the documentation for Enphase(R)'s products and services.

More details on the project are available from the link:../../../../README.adoc[project's homepage].

== Request

A HTTP `GET` to the `/ivp/ensemble/secctrl` endpoint provides the following response data.

As of recent Gateway software versions this request requires a valid `sessionid` cookie obtained by link:../../Auth/Check_JWT.adoc[Auth/Check_JWT].
