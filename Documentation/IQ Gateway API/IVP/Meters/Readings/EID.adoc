Get specific meter’s readings by Gateway (formerly "Envoy") record ID.

== Introduction

Enphase-API is an unofficial project providing an API wrapper and the documentation for Enphase(R)'s products and services.

More details on the project are available from the xref:../../../../../README.adoc[project's homepage].

== Request

A HTTP `GET` to the `/ivp/meters/readings/{EID}` endpoint provides the following response data.

As of recent Gateway software versions this request requires user authentication and authorisation, see xref:../../../Authentication.adoc[Authentication].
